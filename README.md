# Random Guys

## Overview

The purpose of the project is a test to be a Lydia iOS developer.

This app is using CoreData in order to save as many RandomUser as the device can.

The only non-Apple provided framework is [Masonry](https://github.com/SnapKit/Masonry), used for an simpler use of AutoLayout.

The project took me about 5 hours.

## Setup

```
bundle install
bundle exec pod install
open RandomGuys.xcworkspace
```

## Random users fetch

Random users are fetched at each app launch and by hitting the `+` button.
